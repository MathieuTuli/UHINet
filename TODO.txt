- backend return image to frontend based on coordinate (polygon request) and coords of viewing window
- frontend
   - request to backend needs to send polygon coords and viewing window coords
- backend needs to get landsat image for viewing window, and stitch them together, then return before, after, and difference with tl/br coords

other...
- frontend
  - send polygon + viewing coordinates
  - send building properties
  - interface
    - recv image
    - overlay it
    - filter between the before, after diff
    - polygon tool
    - generate button
    - building properties selection
    - search bar
    - seasons? -> time selector
    - make it look pretty
    - transparency of layers (heat map)
    - toggle between satellite and coloured map
- backend
  - train small image patches
  - train on building energy maps
  - train building heat maps
  - take in building properties, time, and coords, and return predictions + stitched heat maps
  - generating new image based on properies

properties
  - building material not really, so height, expected energy consumption
